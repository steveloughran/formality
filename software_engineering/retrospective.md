From a software engineering perspective there is very little of relevance before then.

There a few ones which need mentioning

In UE-10Y, (CE 1960) John McCarthy, wrote the paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I" [McCarthy-10], invented the configuration language for Emacs Lisp many years before Emacs Lisp itself was invented in 15UE. The documentation of this configuration language, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" [Ableson15] is widely regarded as one of the seminal books on the philosophy of coding, and an introductory guide to maybe getting copy and paste working.

In UE-08Y, the Atlas Computer shipped [with virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory#History). This introduced a new problem "page faults", but since then: the ability for one job/task to slow everything else down by spilling to disk.

In UE-06y, the [IBM 360 was announced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360). This is one of the most seminal projects in computing technology though it is often underappreciated. The MIT book [IBM's 360 and Early 370 Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262517201/ibms-360-and-early-370-systems/) [Pugh33], covers this and should be read by everyone especially those who think their projects are hard. This team had to invent integrated circuits FFS. Before they became the first CPU to ship with cache memory, someone had to write and run the simulation to show that cache + slow memory was as good as magnetic core memory;[] a technology only referred to as "core" describing any memory, just as we now use "solid state disk" to describe persistent memory that has no moving parts]. The 360 project developed and shipped floppy disks -purely as a way of loading the microcode of the CPU. Those were just some of the things they came up with, along with CPU innovations like out of order and speculative execution. The 360 project was also notable in that the company design an instruction set and model of the computer to the programmers independent of how multiple iterations actually implemented it. That is: they split up the interface and implementation in CPU architecture, long before DL Parnas proposed it for software.

In software engineering, it is most remembered for the Mythical Man Month [Brook05]. The experience of that project and of other major pieces of software lead to the seminal "Nato summit" of UE-2Y; also known as the "Nato 1968 Summit" for unknown reasons.
